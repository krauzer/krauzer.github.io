			My name is Dylan, and I'm from Central NJ.<br/> 
			I've come to code for a variety of reasons, most of all because I'm interested in creating products that allow for greater creater development and easier managment of illness. 
		</p>
		<p>
			But enough about that.<br/> 
			This project is coming along and has made me realize how much of the particulars of html I've forgotten. I've made a very basic website before, but here I am <em>pretty</em> rusty. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Where will this go? <br/>
			I'm hoping to position everything nicely when it's all finished. Here's hoping to it having some substance there.

			The constellation <em>Cancer</em> consists of: 
			<li>five main stars</li>
			<li>seventy-six <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_designation" target="_blank">Bayer</a> Stars.</li>
			It's easier to recogize the main stars, though, so that's why constellations are hard to find.

		<h5>What led me to this tidbit...</h5>
		<p>
			Is that I'm reading a book called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emperor_of_All_Maladies">The Emperor of All Maladies</a>. And Hippocrates named the illness, cancer, what he did because he thought a tumor looked like a crab. Just the latest on my non-fiction reading list. Perhaps one of these days I'll get back to fiction but with useful factoids like that it might be a while...

			Hit <a href="mailto:dykrause@gmail.com">me</a> up if you have any good reads. I'm always looking for a book.

		<ol>I enjoy: 
			<li>Science Fiction</li>
			<li>Fantasy</li>
			<li>Victorian Lit</li>
