					It is common with programming concepts, I've learned, to teach via familiar ideas and structure. What often can be added is some sort of focus on a practical application, or at least a real world goal that can be in some way translated to the construct being learned and its implementation. Therefore, this blog approaches the concept of classes in Ruby, with this goal in mind: to mirror the real world with the digital. Code often benefits from pseudocode, approaches simplified enough that they are not stuck along anyone specific language. Consider this pseudoconstruction for Class construction.

					Ruby is an object-oriented language. This means its code can work abstractly much in the same way things do in the real world. On a certain level, everything is a collection of properties. A dog is a collection of biological and conceptual traits. It can interact with its surroundings in certain expected or predicted ways. When we see these traits and interactions, we know that this is a dog we're dealing with or observing. The same for objects in an object-oriented language. The only difference is, these objects are limited in creativity by the coders who created them or the pathways that led to their creation and the laws of whatever programming language they exist in. They are bound by computer logic not by nature.

					This comes with relative limitations, since the physics of nature is infinitely complex, but also offers advantages that nature doesn't afford us.

					Consider a flower. In the real world, we can take a seed and plant it. We can grow it and we can observe it. We can also run trials like Mendel did with his pea plants to learn about them. But this takes time. Object-oriented programming offers the opportunity to circumvent that time barrier.
