						I've often thought about conflict and all of the aspects surrounding it. As somebody who likes to write, I know conflict is a driving force in stories because it is a driving force in life. It's almost an abstract idea. Sometimes when you look at all the particulars of conflict--fighting, arguments, jealousy--you're left with something that defies reason. Other times conflict is the most logical culmination of a situation. If fits right into how the world seems to work.  
					</p>
					<p>
						I ultimately don't have a high opinion of conflict. It's another aspect of life. It's my opinion that it is our decisions surrounding the conflict that leads to problems or resolutions, not the conflict itself. So it is those things that we have to analyze. This is why something like the compass of shame is important. If we can apply such a thing universally to all conflicts we face, isn't ourselves that we have to understand? 
					</p>
					<p>
						I don't know if this classifies as an emotional conflict, but it was an important conflict in my life and one that seems to continue repeating itself in different forms. It is the subtle conflict that plays to my personality and flaws, and thus one of the more dangerous conflicts for me. 
					</p>

					<p>
						As a sufferer of Crohn's Disease for nearly fifteen years, I have had several doctors. The relationship between a patient and a doctor is a strange one. It can be cold and impersonal or borderline familial. On one side you have a highly trained professional who is there present the best options and on the other you have a person dealing with their own health who ultimately has to make the decisions. Personalities of each can vary widely and this is reflected in their interactions. 
					</p>

					<p>
						 Long story short, a couple of years ago, the doctor I had at the time suggested I go on a pretty intense maintenance medication. I've learned that a doctor's suggestion is not only their professional opinion, it's the course they feel most comfortable pursuing with you as their patient. So whether you say yes or no isn't just some passing matter. It affects how they'll treat you and how they'll cope with your illness. It's not a suggestion they take lightly. But the reality of being on such medication was very frightening, and the decision embodied a fundamental change to potentially the rest of my life. The gap between that moment, with its heavy choice, and the context, the day-to-day regularity and situation I had settled into, was something that overwhelmed me. 
					</p>

					<p>
						But, again, the situation was one that catered to my flaws. I waffled on the issue for as long as I could, and since it wasn't my doctor's job to argue with me, he eventually gave up on the issue after, at most, expressing visible and continued frustration but never any direct conflict.  
					</p> 

					<p>
						I know it doesn't sound much like the type of conflict you think of when you hear "emotional conflict," but I believe it was a conflict that played itself out in one of the only ways it can between a patient and doctor. I've learned that doctors can be very meticulous in their interactions with patients, they know how to deal with frustration and anxiety, and they know when not to push an issue further. I know I used that and the professional relationship I had with my doctor to my advantage to avoid making a decision until I could pretend it was never really a possibility in the first place. I coasted on a very low, unspoken conflict until we moved on.  
					</p>

					<p>
						I still think about that conflict because it's somewhat recurring in my life, since I have Crohn's Disease and some significant change whether it be medication or surgery is always looming behind a corner and some carefully constructed words. 
					</p>

					<p>
						What's difficult for me is that I know I put myself in a poor situation; I know I bore the brunt of all of the negative consequences of my waffling; I know I brought about the actual conflict in its entirety. What's worse is that I don't think I've resolved much on this front. If I could go back what would I do? I don't know. Try to talk it out more? Accept my overwhelming fears? I still am fearful of such a decision. I'm afraid of the situation these conflicts put me in. I'm ashamed of both this fear and the reality of not having control over my own health. 
					</p>

					<p>
						The silver lining is that I can think about these things, consider and analyze them. I like doing it. It is in contemplation that I hope I can find some understanding, even if no personal resolution can be obtained. I like to think of myself in the abstract too. I can never know how I'll react to a situation until I'm in it, but I believe if I fully comprehend the complexity and consequences, the feelings of those involved, I will make a decision that is graceful and dignified. That is all I can hope for.
