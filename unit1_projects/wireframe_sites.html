	<p>Clear, concise, readily available science and technology news/updates. In science, there are stories from many topics an interested reader might want to peruse but few sites on the web that provide them with no diversions. The problem is the majority of news oriented sites are embracing cleaner design and moving to either a more "headline" oriented format or a site based on commentary and blogs. Phys.org solves the problem of access to information. The principles of its design are focused on allowing readers to find and manuever between the topics that interest them, no frills attached. The main challenge it faces is a potentially niche audience. The visuals are not hip and, on the surface, may look outdated. The subtlety of its layout comes as a double-edged sword. This is definitely not a site that tells a reader what they want. People only go here when curious about science.</p>

	<p>How does a site balance providing thoughtful information about books with the dynamics of a social site that might drive some people away? Goodreads answers this. Its success lies in going direct when it comes to the books and keeping the social component relatively subdued. The eye sees books, information about books, opinions about books. It must look for other things. Based on its design, one can easily find new and old books. If you discount reviews, the layout is probably around 90% geared to information about books and 10% social. For those that want more social interaction, the site allows an easy path that wants it. For those that wants less, the site keeps the majority hidden in the corners and on never used pages. The visual challenge, I think, is in avoiding thumbnail overload. Bookcovers are bookcovers. They're rectangles. When you put them on the site, they make good thumbnails. But there lies the problem because user profile pics are thumbnailed. A lot of books and a lot of users make for a lot of thumbnails, and it can detract from the appeal of the site.</p>

	<p>This website aggregates music posted on blogs and delivers it to viewers with incredible ease. I think the problem it is solving is the difficulty in navigating to and discovering audio. There are very few images on this site. The largest fonts are saved for the names of artists and songs of playable content. Playable content is most important and always placed at the center. But a viewer can find what they are looking for, whether it is a genre of music or a particular song because absolute material volume is kept at a minimum. A visual challenge may be that, without images, the breaks between content are subtler. Any one specific piece is hardly ever more engaging than another, so the viewer has to make a conscious choice when picking material.</p>
