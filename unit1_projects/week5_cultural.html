				<p>The tech industry, like most industries, has its fair share of problems. No human endeavor is perfect, and I think the pitfall with tech is to paint it with a rosier brush than it deserves. Of course, the industry has provided its fair share of benefits to the people and society as a whole, but again like with all industries, I think it is important to analyze it in context of what it is, what it has to offer, and how it has not only met the expectations people have set for it, but also how much it has fulfilled its inherent potential.  </p>
				<p>

The complaint made here is a broad one, not because any one specific problem doesnâ€™t deserve focus but because perhaps a better mindset might contribute a little to solving all of them. 

				</p>
				<p>
					To put it simply, sometimes I wonder whether the tech industry has just followed the path of least resistance. You look at some of the biggest things they have offered, and you must question: have they been the easiest to produce? Opening discussion. Connecting people.  Providing information. All monumental achievements but were they achievements because the creative minds of tech dug deep and pushed ahead to a new frontier or were they just our natural tendencies unfolding like a piece of paper?
