				<a href="week1_cultural_blog.html">Looking back</a> at my examination of values, I can't help but notice that most of the ones I focused on tended to have a more personal tint. I don't know if this is a sign of selfishness, but I'd like to think that a better understanding of one's self and one's actions lead to the biggest outward gains, even gains that translate into accountability towards environment around you. 
			</p>

				I think this can be understood in the context of flaws. You're bound to repeat history's mistakes if you don't study history itself, the saying goes. The same can be said of the personal. If you don't understand your own inherent flaws and prejudices, they're bound to come out. No person is beyond need to reflect, nor is he or she fundamentally more moral or gracious from birth. That's my belief anyway. 
			</p>
			<p>
				When examining my values in reference to stereotype threat—the threat of being hindered by and succumbing to any stereotype externally projected on to you—I really am unsure if I am capable of drawing some more insightful conclusion. I referenced introspection as an important value. In theory, introspection should challenge the threat of stereotype or stereotyping others. I know, though, that in practice, it isn't so simple. But the value in introspection is an understanding that the act itself is never complete. There is no end nor is there some perfect, obtainable meditative state. Introspection must be kept up. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I think stereotype threat is a difficult burden to overcome.  It is one of those things that afflicts us most when we're forgetful or when we settled into some comfortable pattern. There isn't some easy answer for mediating stereotype threat. At best, we can keep up our awareness and compassion. Introspection helps with that, but it can also distract by telling us to focus on the internal. The shock of an external threat, whether it be one of stereotyping or some other harmful projection, may then inflict all the more painful. Some level of thick skin is necessary for protection, but how can one form that skin in the least emotionally impactful way? It is a frustrating topic for me and somewhat saddening. I believe it points to our flaws as human beings. We're not blessed with some perfect consciousness. We cannot rely on obtaining some transcendent state. Not one that can be found in any given moment, let alone one that lasts for a lifetime.  Our burdens vary, and we cannot assume too much of others.  
			</p>
			<p>
				There are many approaches to dealing with a difficult situation or a down and out mood.  I think the one I've developed and have found effective is to examine myself in the context of a much greater timeframe. For me, a little breathing and a little belief that some better time resides somewhere in the future provides me with motivation. A life is a short, but years, months, and days are even shorter. If we put in the proper effort in the current moment, we can believe that we're building the framework for a better situation in a future one. It's also a somewhat pragmatic mindset. Realistically, you can't expect gains to materialize out of thin air. You have to work towards them. But it is important to imagine them and to believe they are possible.
