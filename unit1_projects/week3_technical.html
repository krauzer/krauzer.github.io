				JavaScript

				The language is JavaScript. It's synonymous with Web Development, and many people starting to learn code may wonder why. Why JavaScript over anything else?

				<p>
					The simplest, most fundamental answer is that it's already there! The web has a history of integration and development specifically with JavaScript, and the language is basically defaulted to be the go to for front-end development. JavaScript is the only language with which you can pop open a broswer and start working with right away. 
				</p>
				<p>
					It is important for people to know the distinction between core JavaScript and client-side JavaScript because this is crucial in understanding its use in front-end work. Core JavaScript is the fundamental language itself. It is the syntax, logic, typing, and all the other good bits. It is what you use to evolve into things like Node.js.
				</p>

				<p> 
					Client-side JavaScript is JavaScript that has been integrated into browsers. It is, essentially, JavaScript that has been built up and made more versatile, specifically to cope with what browsers do and have to offer. There is a standard and are recommendations for what client-side consists of, but what client-side JavaScript is capable is defined by the specific browser you're working on. An older version of Internet Explorer does not offer the same methods that the newest version of Google Chrome does, for instance. This is why libraries like JQuery exist. It uses the most fundamental JavaScript that every browser offers in order to create uniform functionality across browsers for developers. 
				</p>

				<p>
					Beyond the ubiquitous nature of JavaScript, the language is well liked for web development because it is high-level and dynamic. This means it works in the abstract and executes at the run-time. If you have an abstract idea, say some direction (add a bunch of lines), you don't have to code all the fundamental components of that direction; a lot of the time you can just lay out relatively abstract code. Executing at the run-time allows for easier manipulation of the code. As you can imagine, on the web where everything is expected to adapt to constant changes, this is very important. 
				</p>
				<p>
					JavaScript is also dynamically, weakly typed, and this is big. Essentially this means, there is more fluidity in JavaScript when it comes to interpreting the type of an object. Many functions are type dependent. In the world of web development there has to be fluidity between all that is going on. JavaScript allows for that. 
				</p>

				<p>
					These reasons are just the tip of the iceberg, but they help explain why JavaScript is so popular for web development. It is a powerful tool that allows for a lot of versatilty. It is shaped for web development. Any good programmer takes what it has to offer and runs!
