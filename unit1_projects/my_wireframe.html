				The Design I'm going for here is a simple, basic one with that draws focus to the center, but also does not detract from the header. This page is an Introduction. Not only to myself but to how I present things.

					As you can see by the wireframe illustrations, the page is built around a central project box that responds to the browser. I think the main point to get across here, is that whether you're on a mobile or on a computer, there is the same amount of clutter, almost none. The attempt is to make the design fit equally across all platforms. The header is stabilized to the left up top, but it doesn't need to respond because it's rather unassuming and it naturally fits well at all pixel widths. The flanking designs are the hardest to come up with and are a work in progress. I think I need some Javascript and CSS animation to deal with them. The page can also be split by halves (top and bottom) and are built to incorporate some more involvment in the top half, but I forgot to mark that out on the wireframes.
