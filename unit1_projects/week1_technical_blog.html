				Considering my Favorite Websites <span id="date">April 27th, 2014</span>
			</div>
			<div id="content_objectives">
				The importance of design cannot be understated, even with the simplest websites. The following is a consideration of three of my favorites websites. Luckily, they each deliver different types of information and thus employ different forms of engagement. 
			</div>
			<div id="content_text">
			<h5><a href="http://phys.org" target="_blank">Phys.org</a></h5>
			<p> <i>Phys.org</i> is a science news site that I found via Reddit. It covers news on science and technology, reported through fields like biology or physics, with an emphasis on detailing research. It's very focused and informative. Perhaps, it can be considered serious, niche, and practical. But the appeal of it is in its no frills approach. If I want to browse science news, I look no further than phys.org. There's almost nothing extraneous you to wade through. </p>

			<p>Arriving on the home page puts you into view of about seven stories split into two sections. But easily moving through subsections is the positive here. Stories from nine science fields and those aggregated by popularity, comments, date, rank, inclusion of video, etc are all easily navigated to via headers. The eye is drawn to the banner but that is almost a byproduct of how inconspicous the rest of the page is. It's just information and a couple of thumbnails.</p>

			<p>I'd describe the site visuals as textual, basic, structured, repetitive, and functional. Some of these don't sound like positives, but I don't go to a news site to look at pretty things. I believe the site was built around a principle to avoid distraction, something that is useful when reading news. </p>

			<p>Navigating through the site is very easy, both from the home page and from article pages. This is because the content isn't diversionary and the paths almost always go through the header or a sidebar. </p>

			<p>This is a site you can be proud to procrastinate on. You almost certainly come out more informed than when you went in. </p>

			<h5><a href="http://goodreads.com" target="_blank" >Goodreads</a></h5>
			<p>According to wikipedia, Goodreads is a "social cataloging" website, which is an appropriate term for it. It doesn't try to sell you anything directly, although it is owned by Amazon, and it almost certainly data mines. The purpose is simple. Data mine, for sure, but also provide a resource for learning about books and what people think about them. It's casual, informative, open, restrained, and maybe a little sly. </p>

			<p>The homepage isn't my cup of tea. If you have an account it's almost entirely updates or new discussions, both of which I don't read. The normal homepage is a standard account sign up page, which could be improved. There's nothing that really stands out close up or far away. The worthwhile pages, for me, are account pages (my own, others, and those for books). On these pages, it's incredibly easy to find book,  reviews, and new information. An account page has 4-5 different listings of books, presented in different forms. </p>

			<p>The design is very comfortable. It's approachable, and it draws you in. The social component is restrained, usually pushed off to a sidebar. There is a lot of open space on the typical page. The thumbnails are small, and the entire site operates almost in a two-color scheme (white and light tan).</p>

			<p>The website solves the issue of dealing with an ulimited amount of books. How do you present all that potential? You let users do it for you. Community is crucial for building up accessible data. Navigation is not that easy, but there is some benefit in that. For instance, it's difficult to navigate to the discussion pages from any given page, but it's a positive if you aren't interested in reading such material. What you don't want to see stays hidden.</p>

			<p>This is another site where you can be productive with procrastination if your intent is to find some books to read. The drain of reading discussions and reviews could have some impact, but again, they are a component of the website isn't really forced, so if you don't want to go that route, you don't have to.</p>

			<h5><a href="http://hypem.com" target="_blank">Hype Machine</a></h5>
			<p>Hype Machine, unlike the other two websites focuses on audio. It aggregates songs posted on blogs and allows visitors to listen to them. Thus, there is a demphasis on images and text, and a priority placed on finding something to listen to. It is funcional, engaging, restrained, purposed, and casual. </p>

			<p>When looking at the homepage, you are drawn to the posted songs, whatever is updated at that moment. Even those these objects are primarly text, their font size is greater than anything else on the page. That is how they capture your attention. Visuals are very basic. Like Goodreads, a small number of colors are used, this time green, black, and white. It is soft and clean. Save the energy for that Deadmau5 remix. A lot of empty space is provided. The visuals mirror the purpose. </p>

			<p>Navigation isn't too difficult. This is because you move by browsing and searching. The site is built to let you browse. With providing audio as the goal, it is as easy to find a song on the homepage as it is on any other page. </p>

			<p>This again, is a unique site when it comes to procrastination and long term use. There is very little textual content. It is unlikely taht most people waste their time navigating through this site, reading things. But you can have it open all day for listening to music. This is a crucial component of its success. This is not a site that makes you bored or anxious. This is a site to see what's new. </p>
