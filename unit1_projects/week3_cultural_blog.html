					One of my biggest concerns coming into Dev Bootcamp was that because it had been around for so long relative to other programs, it might be suffering from some sort of educational tunnel vision. Not that this is always a bad thing. Some might think of it as <em>moving forward</em>.
				</p>

					<p> Every person, every business, and every institution has to move forward. They have to progress and get better. They have to improve, not only to survive, but also because it's just in their nature. Remaining static is hard on the mind. But, as I see it, there is an inherent danger in the need to move forward. What does it mean, really? Is it expansion? Reaching a wider audience? Does it mean obtaining higher quality material? Does it mean more profit? Does it mean thinking outside of the box and developing better mindsets? All of these are good questions, but do they produce good answers? 
				</p>
				<p>
					As I think of these questions, I think about the nature of questions. All questions promote thinking, and thinking narrows into answering. Even rhetorical questions have some sort of answer, if not a direct, unspoken one, then in the rhetoric itself. And the problem with answers is where they seek to go. That they're definable, potentially viable, and create a path to some solution. But what if a path isn't what is needed? What if there is some other way of improvement? 
				</p>
				<p>
					It's like Facebook. Everyone complains about the ever-changing Facebook, the new features that always come around. But I think about what it must be like to be a developer at Facebook. You have sit there and think, "We must <em>move forward</em>.... We can't just stay the same." And then you find ways to move forward, you find answers, and then you impliment them. That is the nature of development, and not just the computer kind. 
				</p>
				<p>
					And this is what I was worried about for Dev Bootcamp. When you have to move forward, you have to find answers. And the program must be at the stage where they're searching for answers. Listening to Sheeref, though, I was amazed at which this is articulated not to be the case. And I was amazed at the consistency which he reminded how difficult it is not to fall into particular mindsets. Dev Bootcamp seems not to move forward but to grow outward, reaching its feelers out and testing for experiences that can add to the experimental nature of the program.
				<p>
					It is not a path program, it is a growth program. This, of course, fits very well with what was emphasized from the beginning about fixed and growh mindsets. But it's easy to see that early reading as just a nice little idea, something that can be forgotten once you get to work. Because in many ways, growth is difficult to maintain. If it is hard for a single mind to grow outwardly, how much harder will it be for an institution, which is less abstract, consists of many minds, and must rely on some sensible structure? But, just as with the personal growth mindset, a growth mindset for an institution can be big. It can keep the fire going. And it can spark the innovation. It was hard to see at first how Dev Bootcamp can be this way, but the vision is starting to take shape for me. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Because of this, I have become extremely excited to continue on into Dev Bootcamp. My expectations have only grown the more I've dealt with the people there. I see it as a growing and thoughtful community. I think, even if the coding experience isn't as successful as I want it to be, the growth experience will be positive enough that I'll leave with a favorable opinion. It occured to me earlier that this might be one of the reasons the program gets such positive reviews from graduates. If there is no phoning it in when it comes to development as a learner, most people probably graduate feeling like they've improved in at least one area of life. So even if you don't have a near 100% success rate with coding, you can with a more personal growth quality. 

				<p>
					This is exactly what I want. I try to be an open thinker and an experimenter, but I fall into mindsets. I'm a believer in patterns and that can leak into believing in and relying on structure. But that doesn't always translate well into learning. It is with hope that I continue on with phase 0. I'm not nervous about this, so much as I'm still nervous about all the social aspects of the program, but that is a different story. 
				</p>

				<p>
					Usually, I would hesitate to give a program such praise before I've actually entered into the main part. But in this case, I know much of the expectations rest on me. I have faith in the potential; I must have trust in myself. So, for anyone actually reading this, know that what I see and praise is the posibility. The posibility that the restrictions will be few and the future will be open. I haven't encountered anything yet to indicate otherwise, and until I do, I shoudln't not sound defeatist. I won't detract from what I can be and do over these next fifteen weeks.
